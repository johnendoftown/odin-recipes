    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Miso Soup is a traditional Japanese soup that can take many forms, but is quite simple on a fundamental level. 
        It consists of a broth made from simmmered bonito flakes (dried fish) and kumbu, a type of seaweed mixed with miso paste, a fermented soy bean mash. 
        Dashi can be made from the raw ingredients or purchased premade, the choice is up to you!d
        It tastes like a salty, umami, from-the-ocean soup and can have many vegtables and protien options added!
